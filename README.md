# **Simulation/Animation Framework for Encapsulation/Decapsulation Concepts**

## **Overview**  
This project implements a simulation and animation framework to demonstrate the processes of **encapsulation** and **decapsulation** in the OSI model. The framework provides a visual and interactive representation of how data is transformed and transmitted across network layers, ensuring a deeper understanding of networking fundamentals.  

## **Features**  
- **Encapsulation**: Demonstrates how headers and trailers are added as data traverses the OSI layers.  
- **Decapsulation**: Illustrates how headers and trailers are removed at the receiving end.  
- **Visualization**: Dynamic animations to show data transformations in real-time.  
- **Educational Use**: Simplifies abstract concepts, making them more accessible to students and professionals.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend**:  
  - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface and animations.  

- **Backend**:  
  - Node.js for processing encapsulation and decapsulation logic.  

- **Tools**:  
  - CSS animations for real-time visualizations.  
  - Optional: NS3 for advanced network simulations (future integration).
